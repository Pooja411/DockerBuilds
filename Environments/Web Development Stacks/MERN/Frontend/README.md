# Frontend

Minimal Setup with Docker, Vite and React.
To get started, just:

```
docker compose up --build
```

This will run three containers for Frontend, Backend and MongoDB.
It supports live reload out of the box, with vite and nodemon, so you can start editing the code right away.

- Frontend hosted at port : **5173**
- Backend hosted at port : **3000**
